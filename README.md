# Model Cortical Folding

This is a final project for CSE 397.

This repository compares mechanical buckling and Turing reaction-diffusion models of cortical folding:

- **mechanical_model**: Implements the Euler–Bernoulli buckling formulation.
- **turing_model**: Implements a two-species reaction–diffusion system.
- **comparison**: Quantifies similarities between pattern outputs.
- **utils**: Helper functions for numerics and plotting.
- **notebooks**: Interactive demonstrations.
